A delimiter is basically just an indicator of a boundary in our code. There, there are three different types:

The {% statement %} delimiter, which indicates that we are going to insert some kind of Python-like code

The {{ expression }} delimiter, which indicates that we are going to insert some value, and

The {# comment #} delimiter, which has no effect on the behaviour of the webpage - it lets us add comments.
